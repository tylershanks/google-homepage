This is a project to recreate the Google home page. This project was done so I could practice the basics of HTML and CSS. The idea was to take a basic webpage and rebuild it entirely in HTML/CSS from scratch. This taught me a lot about different aspects of front end web development.

The biggest challenge for me on this project was getting the page to properly resize based on the browser window size. The Flexible Box (Flexbox) layout made this incredibly simple and really helped me get this page up and running properly.
